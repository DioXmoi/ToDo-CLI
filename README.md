# ToDo-CLI: A Simple Command-Line Task Tracker

This project provides a basic command-line interface (CLI) for managing your tasks. Itâ€™s a simple yet effective tool for keeping track of to-dos, marking them as completed, and organizing your workflow.

***Features***

*  _Adding New Tasks:_ Easily create new tasks with the add command.
*  _Updating and Deleting Tasks:_ Modify existing tasks with update and remove them with delete.
*  _Marking Tasks as In Progress or Done:_ Use mark-in-progress and mark-done to track task status.
*  _Listing Tasks:_ Display all tasks with list, or filter by status with done, todo, or in-progress.
